# Gesture-Recognition
This gesture recognition project uses a webcam mounted on a TV to monitor gestures and control video playback. Commands include "Thumbs up" to increase volume, "Thumbs down" to decrease it, "Left swipe" to rewind 10 seconds, "Right swipe" to fast-forward 10 seconds, and "Stop" to pause. Videos are analyzed as sequences of 30 frames.
